<!-- This code defines a function generatePassword that takes 
    an optional parameter length (defaulting to 8) and creates 
    a password by randomly selecting characters from the charset string,
     which includes uppercase and lowercase letters, as well as digits. 
     The function then returns the generated password.

Feel free to customize the character set or add additional complexity 
to the password generation logic based on your specific requirements. -->
