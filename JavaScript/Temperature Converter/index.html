Create a program that determines if a patient has a fever based on their body temperature reading.
Objectives:-
1- The temperature will be given in Fahrenheit, and you need to convert it to Celsius with one
decimal place precision.
2- The program should display the converted temperature and a statement indicating whether the
patient has a fever or not.
Hints:-
1- A body temperature above 37 degrees Celsius is considered to indicate a fever.
2- Make sure to round the converted temperature to one decimal place using the toFixed() method. -->
